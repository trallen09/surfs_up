### Summary
- The weather stays consistent for the second half of the year.
  - If ice cream weather is considering to be in the 70's, opening a shop would be a good idea.
- They might want to look at this data on a quarterly basis to get a better idea of the down periods. 
  - For the purposes of this analysis, June and December are very similiar in temperature.
